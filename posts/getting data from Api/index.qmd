I came across this awesome post from [Albert Rapp](https://3mw.albert-rapp.de/p/weather-api?utm_source=3mw.albert-rapp.de&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=3mw-getting-weather-data-via-an-api-with-r) about how to get weather data from API and I thought it was a great technique to use. Here we go.

# **What is an API?**

We are focusing on two APIs (application programming interfaces) for our project. Broadly speaking, an API is anything that we can throw code at to get results that we want.

Often this refers to some data source that we tap into. But sometimes it also simply means the syntax of code. For example, `ggplot2` has a very distinctive API, i.e. a code syntax to create a chart.

In our current case, we will just refer to APIs as data sources and we will need to tap into two such APIs, namely these ones:

-   US National Weather Service API

-   Google Geocoding API

The first one will give us weather forecasts based on specified coordinates and the second one will turn any address into coordinates for us. Today, we'll focus on the first one.

# **Making requests to an API**

If you've never worked with APIs, you know that it can feel like data is hidden away behind an API. Thankfully, the `{httr2}` package helps us a lot, even if we've never dealt with APIs before.

Case in point, my fellow YouTubeR (see what I did there? it's "YouTube" and "R") [Melissa Van Bussel put together an excellent video](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0dWJlLmNvbS93YXRjaD92PTh0aWx5cXA0YlpZJmFiX2NoYW5uZWw9Z2dub3QyJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9M213LmFsYmVydC1yYXBwLmRlJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPTNtdy1nZXR0aW5nLXdlYXRoZXItZGF0YS12aWEtYW4tYXBpLXdpdGgtciIsInBvc3RfaWQiOiI0ZTc4MzRiYy1mYzIzLTRjOTYtYjlkMy01ZGM3NTQ4MjMxOTAiLCJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbl9pZCI6ImRjZDRlYWYyLTBhMTYtNGY2ZS1hMjc3LTMyNDg0MWIzOWU5OCIsInZpc2l0X3Rva2VuIjoiZTA3MTA2YjAtMjEyMy00OTBlLTgxMWItMzUyOGRhYTIyOGQ2IiwiaWF0IjoxNzA2NzI4NzgxLCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.v343_UOdVi_yLFz0sfshFChM7XQqSWZl6QZnNhRdFbw) that shows you how to use `{httr2}` to call the API of openAI or GitLab.

Anyway, here's how to make a request to an API to get data:

1.  Navigate to the URL the data can be accessed from

2.  (Optional depending on the API) Authenticate

3.  Get the response

With the National Weather Service, you can easily try this yourself. Just head to the following url using your web browser:

<https://api.weather.gov/points/38.8894,-77.0352>

If you navigate there, you will get cryptic data like that:

This is what is known as a JSON file. More on that later. For now, notice that what you see at the end of the url after `points/` corresponds to the coordinates that are given in the JSON output.

This means that the recipe for calling the weather API is simple: Append `points/{lat},{long}` at the end of the `base_url`, i.e. `https://api.weather.gov/`. In this case, `{lat},{long}` corresponds to the latitude and longitude of the location you want to get weather forecasts for.

# **Making a request with `{httr2}`**

The `{httr2}` syntax to make this work mimics this quite well. Here's how it looks.

![](images/weather_api3.PNG)

Basically, at the core of every request is the `request()` function that needs to know the `base_url`. This returns an `<httr2_request>` object that can be passed to further `req_*()` functions to modify the request.

Here, we used `req_url_path_append()` to modify the request but there are also other functions (and next week we'll learn about `req_url_query()`). Finally, to actually make the request, you can pass everything to `req_perform()`.

# **Getting the response**

As you've just seen, your request will return a `<httr2_response>` and if everything went well, the output will also show you `Status: 200 OK`. You can get the actual content (the JSON that you've seen in your web browser earlier) via one of the many `resp_*()` functions that handle responses.

# **Working with the response**

As you've seen in the output, the JSON file you receive is structured as a highly nested list. To make sense of this data, we use `glimpse()` to understand the structure of the object

![](images/weather_api6.PNG)

And with `pluck()` you can easily drill down into specific parts of the list. For example, this could be used to get the URL for the hourly forecasts

# **Repeat process for forecasts**

With the new forecast URL, we can get new JSON data about the forecasts for our location.

In that output, we can see that there is a list called `periods` inside of the `properties` list that contains lists which always have 16 entries. This might be where our forecast data lives.

![](images/weather_api9.PNG)

Aha! Each of those 16-entries lists seem to correspond to the forecast of one hour. Thus, to get the things like `temperature`, `startTime`, `probabilityOfPrecipitation`, and `short_forecast` into a nice tibble format, we have to iterate over all of these 16-entries lists and wrap the values we want into a tibble.

And once we have that data, we can transform the `time` column into a nice date-time object:

This was awesome. !
